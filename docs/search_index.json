This represents 1 in 5 adults. There are countless stressors and causes of mental illness and we are going to be investigating 6 specific measures in relation to frequent mental distress. The health factors that we will be discussing in this article include the adult obesity percentage, percentage of people getting insufficient sleep, percent of uninsured adults, social associations, median household income, and the percentage of people facing severe housing problems. For clarification, social associations will be used to measure contact with others and involvement in the community. One of the most prevalent types of mental distress is depression. People with depression have a 40% higher risk of developing cardiovascular and metabolic disease when compared to those not experiencing depression. Additionally, those with mental illness are also more likely to be unemployed than the general population (6.5% compared to 5.1) 1. After analyzing our data we found that obesity, insufficient sleep, severe housing problems, social associations, and median household income all have a strong correlation to the amount of frequent mental distress. There was limited evidence that having health insurance or not had a significant impact on frequent mental distress. As an example, higher rates of obesity and severe housing problems are correlated with higher rates of frequent mental distress. On the other hand, higher statistics of social associations is correlated with lower rates of frequent mental distress. Mental health by the numbers. NAMI. (n.d.). https://www.nami.org/mhstats↩︎ "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data", " Chapter 3 Data The data that we are working with comes from the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps program. In our investigation we are going to be looking at measures from 4 different health factors and their correlation to frequent mental distress. These factors include health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors, and physical environment. We are going to be investigating the reported frequent mental distress and this measure comes from the percentage of adults reporting 14 or more days of poor mental health per month (age-adjusted). We are going to be looking at the United States by counties. We have removed the Kalawao County, Hawaii from the data due to missing values across all 3 years we are looking at. Health behaviors are actions that individuals take that positively and negatively affect their health and welfare. An example of a health behavior that leads to improved health would be physical activity. An example of a health behavior that negatively impacts one’s health would be excessive alcohol intake. We are going to be discussing two health behavior measures. The first is adult obesity which measures the percentage of the adult population (age 20 and older) that reports a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2. Obesity has been found The second measure is insufficient sleep which measures the percentage of adults who report fewer than 7 hours of sleep on average (age-adjusted). The second health factor that we will be investigating is clinical care. Access to affordable, quality, and timely health care is important for one’s physical health and we will be investigating whether or not it is also correlated to mental health and prevalence of mental distress. The health measure that we are going to be discussing from the clinical care health factor is uninsured adults. This measures the percentage of adults under age 65 without health insurance. The third health factor used by the County Health Rankings program is social and economic factors which include income, education, employment, community safety, and social supports. For this health factor we are going to be looking at the social associations measure and the median household income. The social associations measure represents the number of membership associations per 10,000 population. This is a rough estimate of the amount of social interaction people have. The median household income measures the income where half of households in a county earn more and half of households earn less. Finally, we are going to be working with one measure from the physical environment health factor which represents the physical environment where individuals live, learn, work, and play. The measure we are going to be discussing is the amount of severe housing problems. This represents the percentage of households with at least 1 of 4 housing problems: overcrowding, high housing costs, lack of kitchen facilities, or lack of plumbing facilities. As you can see in the plots above we have plotted the different health measures for each county. You are able to see the percentage of frequent mental distress as well as the 6 measures that we are interested in. Over the 2 year period (2019-2021) we can see that the entire nation has faced drastic increases in frequent mental distress. In 2019 the Midwest seems to face less prevalence of frequent mental distress than other regions of the country. On the other hand, the South East (East South Central) region has significantly higher rates of frequent mental distress in 2019 and similarly to the other regions, mental health further declines over the next 2 years. In the distribution faceted graph we can see that frequent mental distress has gone up over the 2 year period. The distributions are all symmetrical and evenly distributed. The mean appears to increase by 2 to 3 percentage points over the 2 year period. As you can see in the graph, the percentage of frequent mental distress decreased in a small number of counties (Oglala Lakota, Mora County, Menominee County, Corson County, Falls Church County, Arlington County, Clay County, Ziebach County). We can see from this plot that a vast majority of counties had significant increases in the prevalence of frequent mental distress over the 2 year period. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results", " Chapter 4 Results As previously you have seen the maps of United States according to the Frequent Mental Distress Percentage, in the years 2019,2020 and 2021. You have also seen the factors that contribute to a person’s frequent mental distress. You have also seen how the percentage of frequent mental distress is distributed in the years from 2019 to 2021. Moreover, we have taken a glance at the change of the percentage of frequent mental distress from 2019 to 2021. You can clearly see in the graph ‘Plot of two year change in frequent mental distress %’ that the percentage of frequent mental distress has decreased for a very small amount of counties (Oglala Lakota, Mora County, Menominee County, Corson County, Falls Church County, Arlington County, Clay County, Ziebach County) . You will now build and run the regression models to make better assumptions of the factors which is affecting the percentage of frequent mental distress.

The summary includes the number of observations, minimum, average, median and the maximum of our health outcome pct_mental_distress and also for all the other 6 health measures. Sometimes we need to transform some of the variables to get better results from our regressions. That’s why we checked to see if any of the variables used in our regression model need any transformation. Usually using the logarithm of the variables which doesn’t fit the model well can improve the fit of the model by transforming the distribution to a more normally-shaped bell curve. As you can see in the graph that we have found that only Median Household Income in thousands and Percentage of Adult who are uninsured required the log transformation. You can see in the scatter plot that before the transformation that the points are more skewed and not fitting the line of best fit properly. But after the log transformation in both of the variables you can see that we obtain a regression line more adjusted and fitted throughout the data points. Thus this transformation will result in a better prediction model. The five different models using the same set of 6 explanatory variables are shown below:– Model 1 - Pooled OLS: \\[ \\begin{align} y_{it} = \\beta_0 +\\beta_1 x_{1it} + \\beta_2 x_{2it} + \\beta_3 x_{3it} + \\beta_4 x_{4it} + \\beta_5 x_{5it} + \\beta_6 x_{6it} + u_{it} \\end{align} \\] Model 2 - County fixed effect: \\[ \\begin{align} y_{it} = \\beta_0 +\\beta_1 x_{1it} + \\beta_2 x_{2it} + \\beta_3 x_{3it} + \\beta_4 x_{4it} + \\beta_5 x_{5it} + \\beta_6 x_{6it} + \\sum_{g=2}^{3141}\\alpha_gdS_g + u_{it} \\end{align} \\] Model 3 - Year fixed effect: \\[ \\begin{align} y_{it} = \\beta_0 +\\beta_1 x_{1it} + \\beta_2 x_{2it} + \\beta_3 x_{3it} + \\beta_4 x_{4it} + \\beta_5 x_{5it} + \\beta_6 x_{6it} + \\sum_{y=2019}^{2021}\\delta_ydY_y + u_{it} \\end{align} \\] Model 4 - County Fixed Effect and Year Fixed Effect: \\[ \\begin{align} y_{it} = \\beta_0 +\\beta_1 x_{1it} + \\beta_2 x_{2it} + \\beta_3 x_{3it} + \\beta_4 x_{4it} + \\beta_5 x_{5it} + \\beta_6 x_{6it} + \\sum_{g=2}^{3141}\\alpha_gdS_g + \\sum_{y=2019}^{2021}\\delta_ydY_y + u_{it} \\end{align} \\] Model 5 - State Year Fixed Effect: \\[ \\begin{align} y_{it} = \\beta_0 +\\beta_1 x_{1it} + \\beta_2 x_{2it} + \\beta_3 x_{3it} + \\beta_4 x_{4it} + \\beta_5 x_{5it} + \\beta_6 x_{6it} + \\sum_{gy=2}^{153}\\sigma_{gy}dSY_{gy} + u_{it} \\end{align} \\] Dependent variable: pct_mental_distress OLS panel linear (Pooled OLS) (county-FE) (time-FE) (county-FE and time-FE) (statetime-FE) pct_adult_obese 0.011*** 0.037*** 0.009*** 0.037*** 0.020*** p = 0.0004 p = 0.000 p = 0.0002 p = 0.000 p = 0.000 pct_insufficient_sleep 0.340*** 0.391*** 0.235*** 0.391*** 0.114*** p = 0.000 p = 0.000 p = 0.000 p = 0.000 p = 0.000 log(pct_uninsured_adults) 0.310*** 0.590*** 0.045* 0.590*** 0.785*** p = 0.000 p = 0.0002 p = 0.093 p = 0.0002 p = 0.000 pct_housing_prob -0.007** -0.101*** 0.026*** -0.101*** 0.050*** p = 0.037 p = 0.000 p = 0.000 p = 0.000 p = 0.000 social_assoct -0.032*** -0.049*** -0.030*** -0.049*** -0.014*** p = 0.000 p = 0.000 p = 0.000 p = 0.000 p = 0.000 log(median_income_inthousand) -3.030*** 7.688*** -4.382*** 7.688*** -3.723*** p = 0.000 p = 0.000 p = 0.000 p = 0.000 p = 0.000 Constant 13.082*** p = 0.000 Observations 9,423 9,423 9,423 9,423 9,423 R2 0.690 0.753 0.745 0.753 0.719 Adjusted R2 0.690 0.629 0.744 0.629 0.714 Note: *p&lt;0.1;**p&lt;0.05;***p&lt;0.01 The table shows all the coefficients of our 5 models from which we can draw some interesting conclusions. Firstly we can see that,if we hold all the other variables constant, a one percentage point increase in the pct_adult_obese which is the percentage of the people over age 20 have a BMI of over 30kg/m^2 yields, on average, leads to an increase of 0.020 percentage of people having frequent mental distress. This confirms what we have seen before that obesity has been extensively associated with frequent mental distress. Even though the percentage is minimal, we still consider this statistically significant because Secondly we can see from the table of state-time fixed effect that if we hold all the other variables constant, an increase of one percentage point in the pct_insufficient_sleep which is the percentage of adult people who are having less than 7 hours of sleep on average, also increases the percentage of frequent mental distress by 0.114 percentage. Again it’s pretty natural and also medically proven that if one doesn’t get enough sleep on average that person might have a lot of mental distress. We can also see that in a different way too that, a person have a lot of problems in getting sufficient sleep if the person is mentally distressed frequently. The link between inadequate sleep and frequent mental distress has been viewed historically as a symptom–disease association with sleep inadequacies deriving from preexisting mental distress 2. However, at least 1 study researched the opposite hypothesis, evaluating frequent mental distress leading to a lack of sleep 3. If we notice the third row of the table of state-time fixed effect that by holding all the other variables constant if the percentage point of the adults who are under the age 65 and doesn’t have a health insurance(pct_uninsured_adults) increases by 1% the percentage of frequent mental distress increases by 0.00785 percentage point on average. Here we can think about multiple interpretations as the number of increase is very small we can say that a person having frequent mental distress days doesn’t have anything to do with their health insurance. As mental illness doesn’t have much physical outcomes on health this interpretation seems more logical. Moreover we can also say that the people who have insurance are more likely to be careful about their health and conscious about their mental health too which can help them to no get mentally distressed. But as their are lot other factors which might play into having frequent mental distress this doesn’t agrees with our evidence. When it comes to the Percentage of households in the state-time fixed effect model we can see that with at least 1 of 4 housing problems: overcrowding, high housing costs, lack of kitchen facilities, or lack of plumbing facilities (pct_housing_prob) we can say that by holding all the other variables if the housing problem percentage point increases by one, the frequent mental distress percentage point increases by 0.050 point in average. People might say that it’s a matter of correlation as people with lower median household income tends to have the severe housing problem. But we can’t completely agree to that as for example same amount of household income in different cities might give you different type of options for housing. For instance, the same amount of income in Outgamie county and in Queens County might give one severe housing problem in Queens county not in the Outgamie county. So as a result we think that severe housing problem is rather a causation. When it comes to the effect of number of social associations per 10000 population on the percentage of frequent mental distress in the state-time fixed effect model, we can see that by holding other variables constant, one percentage point increase in social_assoct, results an average decrease of 0.014 in the percentage of frequent mental distress. The logical explanation which we think reasonable is that when a person has more options to get socially involved or be in some events which can easily divert his mind from the stress he is going through. Finally we observe that holding other variables constant in the state-time fixed effect model, 1% increase in the median household income in thousands results in an average decrease of 0.0372 percentage point in frequent mental distress. This seems a bit interesting to explain as an increase in the household income might help a household to give more opportunities of entertainment or good living conditions which may result in a decrease of mental distress. On the other hand, the median income in different counties as said before can bring different type of living. For example the quality of living with a 60K USD median income in Outgamie county compared to Queens County is not gonna be same. But we can also give a counter example that the household in bigger counties or more developed counties might have more opportunity to work on their mental health like more opportunities for entertainment like more park, lakes and so on. But in general an increase of income can lead a household to live in a better condition which results in a decrease of frequent mental distress. We can also see some interesting results in between our 5 different models. As you can see for the variable pct_insufficient_sleep the affect of percentage of insufficient sleep on frequent mental distress is higher when we didn’t count for the county fixed effects. The effects we can see in the model state-time FE are much lower than the effects in our county FE Time model. We think this difference in the coefficient or the effect on frequent mental distress is because of the variation between the counties. Only the county FE and time-FE accounts for the variation of the counties. On the other hand the statetime-FE doesn’t describe the variation of the counties in a state. This pattern can aslo be seen with our other health measures like severe housing problems and social associations, and median household income. .book .book-body .page-wrapper .page-inner { max-width: 90%; } Hanson JA, Huecker MR.

We selected 6 different health measures from these factors to analyze their correlation to mental health/mental distress. Health Behaviors: Adult Obesity Insufficient Sleep Clinical Care: Uninsured Adults Social and Economic Factors: Social Associations Median Household Income Physical Environment: Severe Housing Problems We found that obesity, insufficient sleep, severe housing problems, social associations, and median household income have a strong correlation to the amount of frequent mental distress. Having health insurance or not didn’t seem to effect the prevalence of frequent mental distress nearly as much as we expected. Not having health insurance seems to be something that would cause large amounts of stress for individuals and we expected this to have a significant impact on mental health. However it is clear how measures such as insufficient sleep and obesity can be the result of and also the cause of poor mental health. Across all 6 of our selected health measures we can see how stress levels, physical health, and personal habits are important for one’s mental health.
